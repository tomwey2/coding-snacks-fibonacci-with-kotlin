## Fibonacci number
Fibonacci numbers is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the 
two preceding ones. (*from wikipedia:*)

The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1. The next few values in the sequence are:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

### Definition
The Fibonacci numbers may be defined by the recurrence relation

    F(0) = 0 , F(1) = 1 , 

and

    F(n) = F(n − 1) + F(n − 2) 

for n > 1.
